      <img src="fred.png" alt="Fred Persimmon">
      <p>
        Fred discovered his fascination for all things financial when he opened his first lemonade stand at age 8. He parlayed that into a loan sharking business covering most of central Ohio by the time he entered college. After graduating from Ohio State University, where he was a captain of the fencing team and a national champion, Fred spent time in Europe refining his skills with innovative financial techniques.

      <img src="susan.png" alt="Susan McGoodstuff">
      <p>
        Susan began her professional career as a Navy Seal. Unfortunately she is unable to discuss most of her experience in the military, but we do know it is unwise to mention boa constrictors in her presence. She is also a two time winner of the Fields medal in mathematics although none of us can understand any of her work. She is the only one in the company who understands computers.

      <div class="position-title">Deborah VanTango, <em>Chief of Human Resources</em></div>
      <img src="deborah.png" alt="Deborah VanTango">
      <p>
        Deborah was born in an artist's colony in New Mexico. It was there she discovered her love for unicorns, kittens, and healing crystals. Rather than a traditional college education she joined a Tibetan temple for 15 years. Since then she has worked with Greenpeace, PETA, and the Nevada Gaming Commission. She is the proud owner of 7 cats, 3 birds, and an iguana.
