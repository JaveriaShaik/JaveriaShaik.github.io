      <h2>About it:</h2>
        <h3>Be a Cause of Someone's Happiness!</h3>
          <p><strong>Donate your usable clothes and help those in need.</strong> <br>
            This Ramadan, let's all come together to make a difference. Bring pants, shirts, dress, hats, belts, socks, purses, or anything that could provide warmth and protection from the harsh weather.</p>
      <h2>When and Where??</h2>
        <p>Starting from the beginning of Ramadan till Eid-ul-Fitr, please donate as much as possible to help people in need. In addition to clothing, any other charity donations are also accepted.</p>
        <p>Call your nearby mosques in Canton to drop-off any donations. Spread the word to family and friends and encourage them to donate and help as many people in need. <br>
          A grand lunch held on Eid to appreciate all the donations made.(<em>More details about the lunch will be shared soon</em>)</p>
        <h4>Thank You!</h4>
          <p>Always remember, <q><b>The best among you are those who bring greatest benefits to many others.</b></q></p>
